# MECH105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms that I created for Mech105 utilizing different methods of numerical methods. 

## Repository Content

*Simple Electrical Circuit*

-This code generates a plot of a function that represents the charge on a capacitor from time t=0 to t=0.8 given different charges. 

*Degredation of Aqueous Bromide*

-This code generates a plot displaying both the measured experimental data from the observation of the photodegradation of aqueous bromide, and the expected function. 

*Volume in Tank*

-This code determines the volume of the water in the tank based on the height of a float.

*Creating special n x m matrix*

-This code is a function that returns a n x m matrix with certain specified elements.

*Binary Converter*

-This code is a function that inputs a base 10 numbere and then converts is to binary.

*False Position*

-This code is a developed matlab function which estimates the root of a given function using false position.

*Root Finding Problem*

-This code solves for the angle at which a box that weighs 25 kg will create a force of 150N.

*Linear Algebra*

-This code is a developed matlab function that determines the LU factorization of a square matrix.

*Simpsons 1/3 Rule*

-This is a developed matlab function that works for integrating experimental data using Simpsons 1/3 Rule.

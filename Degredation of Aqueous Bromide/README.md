This code analyses the photodegredation of aqueous bromide for a particular setup given the following 
1. Create a plot displaying both the measured experimental data (using red diamond shapes) and the expected function (using a green dashed line).
2. Plot the function for the first 70 minutes, using one point every 30 seconds (including starting and end point)
3. Include a legend and labeled axes.

This MATLAB code analyses the charge on a capacitor as a function of time and;
1. Generates a plot of the given function from t = 0 to 0.8 given, q0 = 10, R = 60, L = 9, and C = 0.00005.
2. Creates another plot showing the function when the capacitor is 10x greater.
3. Utilizes the subplot function to display both plots side by side.
